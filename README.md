# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

#### Since the size of our dataset is over 25 MB, I have shared through the Kaggle link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?select=creditcard.csv 

🔍Challenges I Faced:

- connecting Streamlit with Kaggle: it took effort to securely connect Kaggle's dataset to the app using API tokens and Streamlit secrets.

- handling large dataset: the Logistic Regression model took longer than expected to train due to the dataset’s size.

- visual output in streamlit: It was initially difficult to render and organize data visuals and results properly within Streamlit.



🌱How I solved the issues and what I Learned during this journey:

- obtained basic functions of streamlit – from layout configuration to writing interactive UI components.

- how to use the Kaggle API to directly download this dataset into the app environment.
